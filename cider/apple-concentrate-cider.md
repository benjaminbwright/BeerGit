# Apple Juice Concentrate Cider

This is one of my favorite brews to make because it is quick and easy. Between mashes of other brews I like to keep this brewing so I always have something great to drink hand. Using concentrate is also a great way to scale up the alcoholic punch of this drink. This recipe calls for a double concentration of juice, but you can go higher if you want.
